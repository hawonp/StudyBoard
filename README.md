### Problem Statement:
Students often have questions related to their coursework that are not easily found on the internet. There may be specific questions that only their classmates or professors could answer. Time that could be better spent studying and revising is lost on hopelessly trying to surf the web for results that may or may not be there. 

We aim to provide a web platform where students can post their individual questions and receive clear answers in turn from their peers and instructors. As such, users of this platform would be able to receive clear instruction from a platform that ranks replies based on reliability. Users would also be free to peruse any subject matter for questions that would aid in their studies. By utilizing these features, we hope that students are able to better understand their course material and collaborate on subjects that remain unclear.
