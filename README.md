### Problem Statement:
People often have questions that they need answering. There might be a specific term that they donâ€™t understand or a topic that they are trying to review. More often than not, these people turn to the internet to try and find an answer. They might be able to find what they are looking for in five minutes, or they might also end up spending hours without much success. Even if they can find answers to their questions, these answers might be vague, factually incorrect, or too poorly explained to understand.

StudyBoard aims to prevent such problems by providing a web platform where anyone with a question in mind can post their thoughts and receive clear and instructional answers. Users are able to interact with one another by leaving replies and sharing posts. Users can also like content that they see, be it question or reply. Users can also flag any inappropriate or incorrect questions and replies. Such posts or their replies are reviewed by moderators and removed if needed. This ensures that no one leaves the platform with the wrong information in hand and that all content is of high quality. Having a unified search bar also helps users peruse through any subject of their choosing.

These features, when combined, facilitates active discussion and improved learning by enabling each person to leave with the exact information that they were looking for.
